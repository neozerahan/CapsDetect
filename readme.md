### Capsdetect displays the toggle status of the caps-lock key in an overlay Window.

## Description
I was getting frustrated unknowningly pressing the caps key while working in Vim. 
So, I created this tiny 'app' in C using WinAPI to display the toggle status of Caps key on the
screen as an overlay window.

Download the Capsdetect.exe from the root directory and run it.

To build the app, run the ./source/build.bat file
