## Description
I was getting frustrated pressing the caps key and forgetting that it's toggled. This can be quite annoying when working with text editors like Vim. 
So, I created this tiny 'app' in C using WinAPI to display the toggle status of Caps key on the screen as an overlay window.

Download the Capsdetect.exe from the root directory and run it.

To build the app, run the ./source/build.bat file
